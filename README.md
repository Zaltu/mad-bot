# mad-bot
Averagely poorly overdesigned Bot for MAD. Includes two main features: `actions` and `habits`.
The bot itself is named Aigis. My waifu UwU. Currently a private bot and not likely to change.

This repo also contains a functional wrapper around the Python `discord` package. This is to add features such as
- sync -> async message sending
- auto-chunking of large messages
- simple connect/disconnect
- simplified callback management

## Requirements
mad-bot runs only on __Python 3.6__. This is because the dependency `discord==1.0.1` requires python 3.6.
I may try and update it in the future, but oof.


# AIGIS
This repo also contains the proper configuration to be run with Aigis as an *external plugin*.
Register this repo (or your fork UwU) to activate it.
